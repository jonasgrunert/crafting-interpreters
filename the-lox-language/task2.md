Can I attach properties to a function and if so can they be a function?

Solution

- What happens if you access a global variable in a function before it is defined?
- What does it mean to say something is "an error"? Runtime error? Compile time?
- What kind of expressions are allowed when a superclass is specified?
- What happens if you declare two classes or functions with the same name?
- Can a class inherit from something that isn't a class?
- Can you reassign to the name that is bound by a class or function declaration?
