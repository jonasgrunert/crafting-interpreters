While I am not quite sure there are a few issues:

- You may still want to guarantee type safety at compile time
- Optimizing for memory allocation with static analysis
- Possible cold start problems

Solution:

- Complex to implement
- Tied to a specifc architecture
- Platform may not allow running generated code
